      "My period is ARTsome is a first of its kind event that took place on Friday November 10 at the Kigali Menstruation Station. It was a photo exhibition about periods in public organized by Dukataze and it explored the experiences of menstruating people in different situations like sports, public transportation, schools, friendships and within the family. The goal of the event was to destigmatize periods and menstruations and show that it a normal life experience.",

      "Rachel Arowolo, program manager at Prickle Academy Rwanda, talked about her experience in Nigeria and how it differs from Rwanda. She talked about how some religions stigmatize periods and label women who are menstruating as unclean. In some churches, when women are on their periods they were not allowed to enter the church. They would have to go through purification. These practices have a long-lastingimpact on women and girls. As her parting message she said, “We should not stop speaking about periods, we should extend the knowledge about periods to parents.” ",

      "Furaha Daniel Bugingo, who was the winner of Let’s Talk About Us (LTAU) club talent in the first cohort talked about the difficulty men have engaging in conversations about menstruation. He reflected on some of the mistakes he made before getting more educated about menstruations like teasing girls who were on their periods when he was at school. One of the questions he was asked was what can be done for men to be involved in SRHR. He responded that men need to be more comfortable naming periods and menstruations and avoid calling them “bya bintu”- the other things and other euphemism. It is also important to stop turning periods into spectacles. Instead of laughing at, or making fun of girls on their periods, they could support them by taking care of things. In the end, he urged everyone to be more curious and strive to have a positive understanding about menses.",

      "There was also Ingabire Emery Jocelyne an SRHR expert who has worked in the pharmaceutical field and now does work within the policy making and community outreach sector. She talked about the stigma still associated with periods in the workplace and how it is often weaponized against women. One example she gave was that in the work place, male colleaguesoften blame periods when women disagree with them. She also talked about the barriers women still have accessing period products. As part of her community outreach work, she met women who would use clay to absorb period blood because they couldn’t afford to buy menstrual products. In the end she acknowledged that even though menstruating can be a painful and difficult experience, it is a normal aspect of life that should not be relegated into private spaces only.",

      "The last panelist was Hallelujah Mahoro a gender activist who works within the women’s rights sector . She talked about how people’s actions have a big impact on the general perception of periods. One time, she sat with a friend for hours in a church because she had stained herself and they had to wait until everyone had left so that they could leave unnoticed. There is still a lot of shame associated with staining yourself in public when on your period.  Often people rush to cover up the person without even notifying her first. This gives the message that it is a shameful thing that needs to be hidden away. She also said that everyone, especially men, should educate themselves about periods. The responsibility isn’t on women.",

      "When the panel discussion was over, there was time for people to network and have a second look at the photo exhibition. Some of the key take aways from the event was the importance of engaging in conversations about menstruations. There is still a lot of shame and stigma associated with periods and normalizing talking about them will go a long way towards reducing the shame and the stigma. There is still a lot of work to be done about access to education about menstruation for everyone- men, parents, and menstruators.",
